GIRLS:    Oh, dry the glist'ning tear, etc

MABEL:    Oh, Frederic, cannot you, in the calm excellence of
            your wisdom, reconcile it with your conscience to say
            something that will relieve my father's sorrow?

FREDERIC: I will try, dear Mabel.  But why does he sit, night
            after night, in this draughty old ruin?

GENERAL:  Why do I sit here?  To escape from the pirates'
            clutches, I described myself as an orphan; and, heaven
            help me, I am no orphan!  I come here to humble myself
            before the tombs of my ancestors, and to implore their
            pardon for having brought dishonour on the family
            escutcheon.

MABEL:    Go, ye heroes, go to glory,
            Though you die in combat gory,
            Ye shall live in song and story.
                 Go to immortality!
            Go to death, and go to slaughter;
            Die, and every Cornish daughter
            With her tears your grave shall water.
                 Go, ye heroes, go and die!

EDITH:    Go and do your best endeavour,
          And before all links we sever,
          We will say farewell for-ever.
          Go to glory and the grave!                 

POLICE:   Yes, it's very evident
          These attentions are well meant,
          Evident, yes, well meant, evident
          Ah, yes, well meant!
