    Oh, Frederic, cannot you, in the calm excellence of
            your wisdom, reconcile it with your conscience to say
            something that will relieve my father's sorrow?

    I will try, dear Mabel.  But why does he sit, night
            after night, in this draughty old ruin?

<p class=" speech">
    Why do I sit here?  To escape from the pirates'
    clutches, I described myself as an orphan; and, heaven
    help me, I am no orphan!  I come here to humble myself
    before the tombs of my ancestors, and to implore their
    pardon for having brought dishonour on the family
    escutcheon.

    <p class="song">
        When the foeman bares his steel,
        Tarantara!  tarantara!
We uncomfortable feel,
        Tarantara!
And we find the wisest thing,
        Tarantara!  tarantara!
Is to slap our chests and sing,
        Tarantara!
For when threatened with -meutes,
        Tarantara! tarantara!
And your heart is in your boots,
        Tarantara!
There is nothing brings it round
Like the trumpet's martial sound,
Like the trumpet's martial sound
        Tarantara! tarantara!, etc.

    Though to us it's evident,
                      Tarantara!  tarantara!
            These attentions are well meant,
                      Tarantara!
            Such expressions don't appear,
                      Tarantara!  tarantara!
            Calculated men to cheer
                      Tarantara!
            Who are going to meet their fate
            In a highly nervous state.
                      Tarantara! tarantara! tarantara!
            Still to us it's evident
            These attentions are well meant.

    Go and do your best endeavour,
            And before all links we sever,
            We will say farewell for-ever.
                 Go to glory and the grave!
